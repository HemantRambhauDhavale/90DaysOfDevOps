# Day 15 – Networking Concepts: DNS, IP, Subnets & Ports

---

## Task 1 – DNS

When I type google.com in a browser:
- Browser asks DNS server to resolve the domain.
- DNS returns an IP address.
- Browser connects to that IP using TCP.
- Then HTTP/HTTPS request is sent.

DNS Record Types:
- A → Maps domain to IPv4 address
- AAAA → Maps domain to IPv6 address
- CNAME → Alias to another domain
- MX → Mail exchange server
- NS → Name server for domain

Command:
dig google.com

Observation:
Found A record with public IP and TTL value.

## Task 2 – IP Addressing

IPv4:
32-bit address written as 4 octets (e.g., 192.168.1.10)

Public IP:
Accessible on internet (e.g., 8.8.8.8)

Private IP:
Used inside local networks (e.g., 192.168.1.5)

Private ranges:
10.0.0.0/8
172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255
192.168.0.0/16

Command:
ip addr show

Observation:
My system IP is private (192.168.x.x)

## Task 3 – CIDR & Subnetting

/24 means:
Subnet mask 255.255.255.0
Total IPs: 256
Usable hosts: 254

/16:
Subnet mask 255.255.0.0
Total IPs: 65,536
Usable hosts: 65,534

/28:
Subnet mask 255.255.255.240
Total IPs: 16
Usable hosts: 14

Why subnet?
To divide large networks into smaller manageable parts.

## CIDR Table

CIDR | Subnet Mask        | Total IPs | Usable Hosts
/24  | 255.255.255.0      | 256       | 254
/16  | 255.255.0.0        | 65536     | 65534
/28  | 255.255.255.240    | 16        | 14

## Task 4 – Ports

Port is a logical endpoint for communication.

Common Ports:

22 → SSH
80 → HTTP
443 → HTTPS
53 → DNS
3306 → MySQL
6379 → Redis
27017 → MongoDB

Command:
ss -tulpn

Observation:
Port 22 listening (SSH service).

---

## Task 5 – Putting It Together

curl http://myapp.com:8080 involves:
DNS resolution → IP routing → TCP connection → Port 8080 → Application response.

App can't reach DB 10.0.1.50:3306:
- Check network connectivity (ping)
- Check port open (nc / telnet)
- Check firewall/security group
- Check DB service status

---

## What I Learned

1. DNS is the starting point of most connections.
2. CIDR helps manage network sizes.
3. Ports define which service is accessed.
