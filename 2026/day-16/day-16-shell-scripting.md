# Day 16 – Shell Scripting Basics

---

## Task 1 – First Script

File: hello.sh

#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, DevOps!"

Commands:
chmod +x hello.sh
./hello.sh

Observation:
Script printed: Hello, DevOps!

If shebang is removed:
System may not use bash interpreter properly.

---

## Task 2 – Variables

File: variables.sh

#!/bin/bash

NAME="Hemant"
ROLE="DevOps Engineer"

echo "Hello, I am $NAME and I am a $ROLE"

Single quotes vs double quotes:
- Double quotes expand variables
- Single quotes print text as it is

Example:
echo '$NAME'
Output: $NAME

echo "$NAME"
Output: Hemant

## Task 3 – User Input

File: greet.sh

#!/bin/bash

read -p "Enter your name: " NAME
read -p "Enter your favourite tool: " TOOL

echo "Hello $NAME, your favourite tool is $TOOL"

---

## Task 4 – If-Else

File: check_number.sh

#!/bin/bash

read -p "Enter a number: " NUM

if [ $NUM -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "Positive"
elif [ $NUM -lt 0 ]; then
  echo "Negative"
else
  echo "Zero"
fi

File: file_check.sh

#!/bin/bash

read -p "Enter filename: " FILE

if [ -f "$FILE" ]; then
  echo "File exists"
else
  echo "File does not exist"
fi

---

## Task 5 – Combined Script

File: server_check.sh

#!/bin/bash

SERVICE="ssh"

read -p "Do you want to check the status? (y/n): " ANSWER

if [ "$ANSWER" == "y" ]; then
  systemctl status $SERVICE
else
  echo "Skipped."
fi

## What I Learned

1. Shebang defines interpreter.
2. Variables and read make scripts dynamic.
3. If-else makes automation possible.
